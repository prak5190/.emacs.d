  If  you ok  that  "glyphicon"  classes allowed  only  for <i>  or
"label-default" for  <span>, <label> and  so on, this may  good for
you.   Alternative you  can use  package `ac-html-csswatcher'  that
parse   all  css   in   prject.   However   this  package   provide
documentation  with samples  and additional  data- attributes  that
`ac-html-csswatcher'  can't provide,  so  ac-html-bootstrap may  be
helpful for you.

Usage:

Use `ac-html-bootstrap+'
