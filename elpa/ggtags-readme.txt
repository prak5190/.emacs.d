A package to integrate GNU Global source code tagging system
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global) with Emacs.

Usage:

`ggtags' is similar to the standard `etags' package. These keys
`M-.', `M-,', `M-*' and `C-M-.' should work as expected in
`ggtags-mode'. See the README in https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags
for more details.

All commands are available from the `Ggtags' menu in `ggtags-mode'.

NEWS 0.8.9 (2015-01-16):

- `ggtags-visit-project-root' can visit past projects.
- `eldoc' support enabled for emacs 24.4+.
