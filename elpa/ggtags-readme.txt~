A package to integrate GNU Global source code tagging system
(http://www.gnu.org/software/global) with Emacs.

Usage:

`ggtags' is similar to the standard `etags' package. These keys
`M-.', `M-,', `M-*' and `C-M-.' should work as expected in
`ggtags-mode'. See the README in https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags
for more details.

All commands are available from the `Ggtags' menu in `ggtags-mode'.

NEWS 0.8.8 (2014-12-03):

- Command `ggtags-update-tags' now runs in the background for large
  projects (per `ggtags-oversize-limit') without blocking emacs.
